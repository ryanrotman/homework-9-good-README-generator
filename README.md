# README Generator

## Description
<!-- This repository holds the homework assignment for Week 9 of the [The Coding Boot Camp](https://techbootcamps.utexas.edu/coding/) through the University of Texas at Austin's Center for Professional Education. -->

This is a command line application that dynamically creates a README from a user's input. It uses Node.js for the runtime environment and the Inquirer package to prompt the user for input.

## Notes
* One critical component to this project in commiting to GitHub is the use of the ```.gitignore``` folder. Because Node Modules are being used we do not want to commit the modules folder and other non-program specific files.

## Instructions

This projected was created using VSCode and then run in the integrated terminal. Assuming that Node.js is already installed, you will need to run ```npm install``` and then you can run ```node index.js``` to launch the application and proceed through the prompts.
